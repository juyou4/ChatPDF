To leverage such indicators of compromise, cybersecurity vendors and practitioners often maintain and update blacklists of known malicious domains and URLs. However, blacklists frequently fail to identify emerging and obfuscated threats. Over the past few decades, there has been significant interest in developing machine learning models that automatically detect malicious domains and URLs, addressing the limitations of blacklists maintenance and updates. In this paper, we introduce DomURLs_BERT, a pre-trained BERT-based encoder adapted for detecting and classifying suspicious/malicious domains and URLs. DomURLs_BERT is pre-trained using the Masked Language Modeling (MLM) objective on a large multilingual corpus of URLs, domain names, and Domain Generation Algorithms (DGA) dataset. In order to assess the performance of DomURLs_BERT, we have conducted experiments on several binary and multi-class classification tasks involving domain names and URLs, covering phishing, malware, DGA, and DNS tunneling.\n\nThe evaluations results show that the proposed encoder outperforms state-of-the-art character-based deep learning models and cybersecurity-focused BERT models across multiple tasks and datasets.\n\nThe pre-training dataset1, the pre-trained DomURLs_BERT2encoder, and the experiments source code3are publicly available. 1Introduction Domain names and Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) are fundamental components in navigating and identifying resources on the Internet. Nevertheless, they are frequently exploited for various malicious activities in cyberspace, such as phishing campaigns, malware distribution, spam dissemination, and Command and Control (C&C) server operations, among others [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].Thus, detecting and flagging malicious domains and URLs is crucial for network security.\n\nTraditionally, cybersecurity vendors and practitioners rely on blacklists and heuristic methods to identify malicious domain names and URLs [6, 7, 8, 9]. While blacklists are essential for blocking known threats, they are reactive by 1https://hf.co/datasets/amahdaouy/Web_DomURLs 2https://hf.co/amahdaouy/DomURLs_BERT 3https://github.com/AbdelkaderMH/DomURLs_BERT\n\nA PREPRINT - SEPTEMBER 17, 2024 nature, posing challenges in maintenance and being vulnerable to evasion techniques. On the other hand, heuristic methods, which use patterns and behavioral analysis to identify potential threats, offer a more proactive approach to detection [7, 10, 11]. However, they are prone to false positives and require continuous updates to remain effective against evolving obfuscation tactics [4, 5, 10, 12, 13].\n\nTo overcome the limitations of blacklisting and heuristic-based methods, a growing body of research has focused on developing Machine Learning (ML) techniques for detecting malicious URLs and domain names [2, 8, 12]. The goal of these approaches is to automatically train models that can distinguish between legitimate and malicious threats based on data. Traditional ML-based techniques rely heavily on hand-engineered features, where the learning process involves identifying patterns in the data to guide the model’s decision-making. Consequently, numerous studies have proposed various feature sets for ML-based classification of malicious domains and URLs [2, 4, 9, 11]. Although ML-based methods have demonstrated promising results across different domain name and URL classification tasks, the manual feature engineering process is both costly and time-consuming [6, 7].\n\nRecently, a considerable amount of literature has been published on the use of Deep Learning (DL) for detecting and classifying malicious domain names and URLs [5, 6, 7, 13]. These studies leverage the representation learning capabilities of deep neural networks, which can automatically learn hierarchical features at different levels of abstraction from raw input data [14]. As a result, various neural network architectures have been explored. Typically, these architectures either use hand-engineered features or learn representations of characters, n-grams, and sub-words for classifying malicious domain names and URLs [6, 13, 15, 16, 17].\n\nThe introduction of the transformer architecture [18] has resulted in significant breakthroughs and advancements in Artificial Intelligence. Beyond natural language processing, transformers have been employed in various fields such as computer vision, data science, robotics, and cybersecurity [19, 20, 21, 22]. Particularly, self-supervised pre-training of stacked transformer blocks—whether in encoder, decoder, or encoder-decoder configurations—has demonstrated state-of-the-art performance when fine-tuned for downstream tasks [23, 24]. In line with the pretrain-finetune paradigm, researchers have proposed fine-tuning or adapting pre-trained Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) [25] for cybersecurity tasks [5, 21, 22, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32]. Following the domain-adaptive pre-training approach, several BERT-based encoders have been pre-trained using the Masked Language Modeling (MLM) objective on domain-specific corpora for the classification of malicious and phishing URLs [22, 29, 33, 31]. However, these models have not been explicitly pre-trained on both domain names and URLs, and much of the existing research has focused primarily on phishing URLs.\n\nIn this paper, we introduce DomURLs_BERT, a BERT-based encoder pre-trained on a large-scale corpus using the MLM objective. The pre-training corpus includes multilingual URLs, domain names, and Domain Generation Algorithms (DGA) datasets. Additionally, we propose a lightweight preprocessing method for the input data and train our model’s tokenizer from scratch using SentencePiece tokenization. To evaluate the performance of DomURLs_BERT in detecting malicious URLs and domain names, we conducted a comprehensive evaluation on a diverse set of datasets covering DGA, DNS tunneling techniques, malware classification, and phishing/malicious URL classification. The overall results show that our model outperforms six character-based deep learning models and four BERT-based models on multiple classification tasks. To summarize, the main contributions of this paper are as follows: • We introduce DomURLs_BERT, a specialized BERT-based encoder pre-trained on a large-scale multilingual corpus of URLs, domain names, and DGA datasets. • We propose a light preprocessing tailored to the characteristics of URLs and domain names, and train domainspecific tokenizer. • We evaluate DomURLs_BERT on various malicious URLs and domain names classification tasks, including DGA, DNS tunneling, malware classification, and phishing. • We conduct our experiments on both binary and multi-class classification tasks. • We compare our model with several state-of-the-art deep learning models, including character-based models and pre-trained cybersecurity BERT models.\n\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews related work in the field of malicious domain and URL detection. In Section 3, we describe the proposed method for DomURLs_BERT pre-training. Sections 4 presents the experimental results. Finally, Section 5 concludes the paper and outlines potential directions for future research. 2Related Work The field of natural language processing is currently undergoing a revolutionary transformation, driven by the advent of large pre-trained language models (PLMs) based on the groundbreaking Transformer architecture [18]. However, 2\n\nA PREPRINT - SEPTEMBER 17, 2024 applying these models to domain-specific tasks poses challenges, as general models often fail to represent domainspecific terms and contexts not covered in their training data. To address this issue, domain-specific PLMs have been developed, such as BioBERT [34] for biomedical text and SciBERT [35] for scientific literature. Similarly, in the cybersecurity domain, several models based on the BERT architecture [25] have been created to capture domain-specific language and improve performance on cybersecurity-related tasks [22].\n\nFor instance, CyBERT [36] is a domain-specific variant of BERT pre-trained on a large cybersecurity corpus using MLM. It focuses on generating contextualized embeddings specifically designed for cybersecurity tasks like cyber threat intelligence and malware detection. In the same context, CySecBERT [21] is a domain-adapted version of BERT pre-trained on large cybersecurity corpora. It is designed to improve performance across multiple cybersecurity tasks, including classification and named entity recognition while addressing challenges like catastrophic forgetting during domain adaptation. CySecBERT has demonstrated superior performance compared to both BERT and CyBERT in several cybersecurity tasks. Additionally, SecureBERT [20], based on the RoBERTa architecture, incorporates continual pre-training with a specialized tokenizer and fine-tuned pre-trained weights to capture both general and cybersecurity-specific language. Evaluated on MLM and NER tasks, SecureBERT has shown promising results in comprehending cybersecurity text. On the other hand, SecBERT [19], developed from scratch, is trained on various cybersecurity corpora, such as \"APTnotes\" and \"CASIE,\" and targets a broad range of cybersecurity data.\n\nMore recently, several models have focused on specific tasks within the cybersecurity domain. For example, MalBERT [37], a BERT-based model, is specialized in detecting malicious software. Similarly, Li et al. [29] introduced URLBERT, the first pre-trained model specifically designed for URL classification and detection tasks. URLBERT incorporates novel pre-training techniques, such as self-supervised contrastive learning and virtual adversarial training, to enhance its understanding of URL structures and robustness, achieving state-of-the-art results in phishing detection and web page classification. Motivated by the success of PLMs in cybersecurity tasks, we propose DomURLs_BERT, a specialized BERT-based encoder pre-trained on a large multilingual corpus of URLs, domain names, and DGA datasets. This paper contextualizes DomURLs_BERT by reviewing recent studies on the classification of malicious domain names and URLs. For a detailed review of existing large language models in cybersecurity, readers can refer to the recent study by Xu et al. [22]. 2.1Malicious domain names classification Detecting malicious domains, especially those generated by domain generation algorithms, is a crucial task in cybersecurity. Early work by Yadav et al. [1] laid the foundation by focusing on detecting algorithmically generated malicious domain names through linguistic analysis. Building on this, Cucchiarelli et al. [9] proposed using n-gram features, enhancing the ability to capture linguistic patterns in DGA-generated domains. Liew and Law [17] further advanced the field by introducing subword tokenization techniques for DGA classification, a method that allows more granular token analysis, improving model robustness against unseen domain variations. Shi et al. [8] explored machine learning techniques, particularly extreme machine learning, for detecting malicious domain names. This approach demonstrates the effectiveness of using machine learning models to identify domains that exhibit abnormal patterns. Tian et al. [32] introduced Dom-bert, a pre-trained model designed to detect malicious domains, leveraging contextual information embedded in domain names to enhance detection performance. In the broader context, Kang [3] reviewed various malicious domain detection techniques, while Hamroun et al. [11] focused specifically on lexical-based methods, emphasizing the importance of features derived from the domain names themselves. Together, these works underscore the importance of both lexical features and advanced machine-learning techniques in detecting DGA-generated and malicious domains. 2.2Malicious URLs classification In the field of malicious URLs detection, machine learning and deep learning approaches have been extensively studied and developed, with significant advancements in recent years. These approaches can be broadly categorized into traditional machine learning methods, neural network-based methods, and transformer-based models. Traditional machine learning methods, which rely on manually engineered features, were initially prominent in malicious URL detection. Sahoo et al. [2] provided a comprehensive survey of these early efforts, highlighting how machine learning techniques such as support vector machines, decision trees, naive Bayes, and random forests were applied to extract statistical and lexical features from URLs. Similarly, Aljabri et al. [4] reviewed more recent methods and highlighted the shift toward deep learning techniques due to their ability to automate feature extraction and improve detection performance.\n\nThe shift towards deep learning led to the development of several promising models. In this context, Le et al. [6] proposed URLNet, a deep learning-based method that captures both character- and word-level representations of URLs 3\n\nA PREPRINT - SEPTEMBER 17, 2024 to improve classification accuracy. Vazhayil et al. [15] performed a comparative study between shallow and deep networks, concluding that deep networks outperform traditional machine learning models by capturing more complex patterns in URLs. Afzal et al. [16] took this further by introducing Urldeepdetect, a deep learning model that integrates semantic vector models to enhance URL representation.\n\nMore recently, transformer-based models have emerged as a dominant approach, driven by their capacity to understand the semantic and contextual information of URLs. As previously mentioned, the BERT model and its variants have been particularly influential in this area. Chang et al. [26] and Otieno et al. [27] explored the application of BERT for URL detection, demonstrating that transformer models outperform traditional methods in terms of both accuracy and robustness. Building on these efforts, Su et al. [28] and Yu et al. [5] proposed modified BERT variants that further enhance semantic understanding for malicious URL detection. The introduction of URLBERT by Li et al. [29], a contrastive and adversarial pre-trained model, continues this trend, pushing the boundaries of transformer-based URL classification. Several other transformer-based models have also been proposed, focusing on improving phishing URL detection. For example, URLTran [33] applies transformers specifically to phishing detection, while Bozkir et al. [13] introduced GramBeddings, a neural network that utilizes n-gram embeddings to enhance the identification of phishing URLs. This direction was further extended by Liu et al. [30], who combined a pre-trained language model with multi-level feature attention for improved detection accuracy.\n\nOverall, the progression from traditional machine learning approaches to advanced deep learning and transformer-based models has significantly improved the ability to classify malicious URLs. The integration of semantic understanding, n-gram embeddings, and pre-trained models has pushed the state-of-the-art, enabling more accurate and robust detection of malicious URLs across different attack types. 3Methodology This section presents our methodology for pre-training the DomURLs_BERT encoder, focusing on the collection of pre-training data, preprocessing of domain names and URLs, tokenizer training, and domain-adaptive pre-training.\n\nTable 1: Pre-training Dataset Training Development domain names 19,941,474 1,049,558 URLs 355,116,387 18,690,330 Total 375,057,861 19,739,888 3.1Pre-training data We have collected a large-scale pre-training corpus of domain names and URLs from the following datasets: • mC4: The multilingual colossal Common Crawl Corpus4. This is a cleaned version of the Common Crawl’s web corpus, curated by the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence [38], containing approximately 170 million URLs. • falcon-refinedweb: An English large-scale dataset curated for large language model pre-training. This dataset is compiled from CommonCrawl, using strict filtering and extensive deduplication [39], and contains around 128 million URLs5. • CBA Web tracking datasets: A dataset compiled by the Broadband Communications Systems and Architectures Research Group6, containing 76M URLs and 1.5M domain names. • Tranco top 1M: is a dataset of top 1M domain names compiled and ranked by Tranco7[40]. • UTL_DGA22: A Domain Generation Algorithm botnet dataset, containing 4.3 million entries from 76 DGA families [12]. • UMUDGA: A dataset for profiling DGA-based botnets, consisting of 30 million manually labeled DGA entries [41]. 4https://hf.co/datasets/legacy-datasets/mc4 5https://hf.co/datasets/tiiuae/falcon-refinedweb 6https://cba.upc.edu/downloads/category/29-web-tracking-datasets# 7https://tranco-list.eu/ 4\n\nA PREPRINT - SEPTEMBER 17, 2024 Since the pre-training dataset is curated from multiple sources, the data cleaning process includes deduplication based on exact matching. The final pre-training dataset contains 375,057,861 samples for model training and 19,739,888 samples for development. Table 1 provides details on the collected dataset, which is publicly available on Hugging Face Datasets8. 3.2Pre-training Procedure 3.2.1Preprocessing Figure 1: Overall URL structure A URL consists of several components, which can be grouped into three main parts: the scheme (protocol), the domain name, and the path. Figure 1 illustrates the overall structure of a URL (source9). Our proposed input preprocessing method involves removing the protocol identifier and splitting the URL into two parts: the domain name and the path.\n\nThese two parts are delimited by special tokens, [DOMAIN] and [PATH], indicating the start of the domain name and the URL path, respectively. Additionally, if the input URL contains an IP address instead of a domain name, we use the [IP] and [IPv6] special tokens in place of [DOMAIN] for IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, respectively. Finally, the [CLS] and [SEP] tokens are appended to the start and end of the input URL or domain, as follows: Figure 2: A sample of preprocessed domain names and URLs 3.2.2Tokenizer training After cleaning and preprocessing the data, we trained our tokenizer from scratch using the SentencePiece tokenization method, which employs the Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) algorithm [42]. SentencePiece is language-agnostic and does not require any pre-tokenization, as it processes input as a sequence of Unicode characters. For tokenizer training, we utilized the HuggingFace tokenizers library10. The vocabulary size was set to 32,000. 3.2.3Domain-adaptive pre-training Domain-adaptive pre-training has been shown to enhance the contextualized word embeddings of existing domaingeneric Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) [43]. This improvement has also been demonstrated in cybersecurity applications, where several domain-adapted models have been proposed [20, 21, 29, 33, 31, 22]. Following this trend, we continued the pre-training of the BERT-base encoder introduced in [25]. The model consists of approximately 110 million parameters, with 12 transformer layers, a hidden dimension size of 768, and 12 attention heads. 8https://hf.co/datasets/amahdaouy/Web_DomURLs 9https://www.seoforgooglenews.com/p/everything-urls-news-publishers 10https://github.com/huggingface/tokenizers 5\n\nA PREPRINT - SEPTEMBER 17, 2024 Pre-training is performed using the MLM objective on our dataset, following the guidelines of Devlin et al. (2019) [25], where 15% of the input sequence’s subwords are randomly selected for masking. The model is trained to minimize the cross-entropy loss between the predicted sequence and the original sequence. We use the HuggingFace transformers11 library for training on a server equipped with 4 NVIDIA A100 GPUs, each with 80GB of RAM. The maximum sequence length, per-device batch size, and learning rate are set to 128, 768, and −4, respectively. The model is 1 × 10 trained for 260,000 steps. Our pre-trained model is publicly available on HuggingFace Models12. 4Experiments and Results In this section, we present the evaluation datasets, the deep learning models used for comparison, the experimental settings, and the evaluation metrics. We then discuss and analyze the obtained results. 4.1Evaluation Datasets To evaluate the effectiveness of our model, we employed several domain name and URL classification datasets. For malicious domain name classification, we used the DNS Tunneling dataset [44], UMUDGA [41], and UTL_DGA22 [12]. Additionally, we collected a malware domain names dataset, ThreatFox_MalDom, from the ThreatFox13database in June 2024. For legitimate domain names, we used the Tranco list.\n\nMendeley AK Singh Kaggle MaliciousFor malicious URL classification, we utilized several datasets, including [45], URLs [46], Grambedding [47], LNU_Phish [48], PhiUSIIL [49], and PhishCrawl [50]. We also curated a malware URL dataset, ThreatFox_MalURLs, from the ThreatFox database in June 2024. For legitimate URLs, we employed the benign URLs from the Kaggle Malicious URLs dataset [46].\n\nAll the used datasets have been divided into 60%, 20%, and 20% for training, validation, and testing, respectively.

DomURLs_BERT is pre-trained using the masked language modeling objective on a large-scale, multilingual corpus comprising URLs, domain names, and domain generation algorithm datasets. We presented a detailed methodology for data collection, preprocessing, and domainadaptive pre-training.\n\nTo evaluate the performance of our model, we conducted experiments on several binary and multi-class classification tasks related to domain names and URLs, including phishing and malware detection, DGA identification, and DNS tunneling. Our results demonstrate that DomURLs_BERT achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple datasets. Furthermore, the findings highlight that character-based deep learning models, such as RNNs, CNNs, and their combinations, serve as strong end-to-end baselines for URL and domain name classification. In comparison, fine-tuning a domain-generic pre-trained BERT model and adapting BERT-based models to the cybersecurity domain consistently outperforms the baseline character-based models on most benchmark datasets. Future work includes evaluating the model performance on other domain names and URLs classification tasks and exploring robust fine-tuning approaches for dealing with adversarial attacks.\n\nReferences [1] Sandeep Yadav, Ashwath Kumar Krishna Reddy, AL Narasimha Reddy, and Supranamaya Ranjan.

To leverage such indicators of compromise, cybersecurity vendors and practitioners often maintain and update blacklists of known malicious domains and URLs. However, blacklists frequently fail to identify emerging and obfuscated threats. Over the past few decades, there has been significant interest in developing machine learning models that automatically detect malicious domains and URLs, addressing the limitations of blacklists maintenance and updates. In this paper, we introduce DomURLs_BERT, a pre-trained BERT-based encoder adapted for detecting and classifying suspicious/malicious domains and URLs. DomURLs_BERT is pre-trained using the Masked Language Modeling (MLM) objective on a large multilingual corpus of URLs, domain names, and Domain Generation Algorithms (DGA) dataset. In order to assess the performance of DomURLs_BERT, we have conducted experiments on several binary and multi-class classification tasks involving domain names and URLs, covering phishing, malware, DGA, and DNS tunneling.\n\nThe evaluations results show that the proposed encoder outperforms state-of-the-art character-based deep learning models and cybersecurity-focused BERT models across multiple tasks and datasets.\n\nThe pre-training dataset1, the pre-trained DomURLs_BERT2encoder, and the experiments source code3are publicly available. 1Introduction Domain names and Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) are fundamental components in navigating and identifying resources on the Internet. Nevertheless, they are frequently exploited for various malicious activities in cyberspace, such as phishing campaigns, malware distribution, spam dissemination, and Command and Control (C&C) server operations, among others [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].Thus, detecting and flagging malicious domains and URLs is crucial for network security.\n\nTraditionally, cybersecurity vendors and practitioners rely on blacklists and heuristic methods to identify malicious domain names and URLs [6, 7, 8, 9]. While blacklists are essential for blocking known threats, they are reactive by 1https://hf.co/datasets/amahdaouy/Web_DomURLs 2https://hf.co/amahdaouy/DomURLs_BERT 3https://github.com/AbdelkaderMH/DomURLs_BERT",

On the other hand, heuristic methods, which use patterns and behavioral analysis to identify potential threats, offer a more proactive approach to detection [7, 10, 11]. However, they are prone to false positives and require continuous updates to remain effective against evolving obfuscation tactics [4, 5, 10, 12, 13].\n\nTo overcome the limitations of blacklisting and heuristic-based methods, a growing body of research has focused on developing Machine Learning (ML) techniques for detecting malicious URLs and domain names [2, 8, 12]. The goal of these approaches is to automatically train models that can distinguish between legitimate and malicious threats based on data. Traditional ML-based techniques rely heavily on hand-engineered features, where the learning process involves identifying patterns in the data to guide the model’s decision-making. Consequently, numerous studies have proposed various feature sets for ML-based classification of malicious domains and URLs [2, 4, 9, 11]. Although ML-based methods have demonstrated promising results across different domain name and URL classification tasks, the manual feature engineering process is both costly and time-consuming [6, 7].\n\nRecently, a considerable amount of literature has been published on the use of Deep Learning (DL) for detecting and classifying malicious domain names and URLs [5, 6, 7, 13]. These studies leverage the representation learning capabilities of deep neural networks, which can automatically learn hierarchical features at different levels of abstraction from raw input data [14]. As a result, various neural network architectures have been explored. Typically, these architectures either use hand-engineered features or learn representations of characters, n-grams, and sub-words for classifying malicious domain names and URLs [6, 13, 15, 16, 17].\n\nThe introduction of the transformer architecture [18] has resulted in significant breakthroughs and advancements in Artificial Intelligence. Beyond natural language processing, transformers have been employed in various fields such as computer vision, data science, robotics, and cybersecurity [19, 20, 21, 22]. Particularly, self-supervised pre-training of stacked transformer blocks—whether in encoder, decoder, or encoder-decoder configurations—has demonstrated state-of-the-art performance when fine-tuned for downstream tasks [23, 24]. In line with the pretrain-finetune paradigm, researchers have proposed fine-tuning or adapting pre-trained Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) [25] for cybersecurity tasks [5, 21, 22, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32]. Following the domain-adaptive pre-training approach, several BERT-based encoders have been pre-trained using the Masked Language Modeling (MLM) objective on domain-specific corpora for the classification of malicious and phishing URLs [22, 29, 33, 31]. However, these models have not been explicitly pre-trained on both domain names and URLs, and much of the existing research has focused primarily on phishing URLs.\n\nIn this paper, we introduce DomURLs_BERT, a BERT-based encoder pre-trained on a large-scale corpus using the MLM objective. The pre-training corpus includes multilingual URLs, domain names, and Domain Generation Algorithms (DGA) datasets. Additionally, we propose a lightweight preprocessing method for the input data and train our model’s tokenizer from scratch using SentencePiece tokenization. To evaluate the performance of DomURLs_BERT in detecting malicious URLs and domain names, we conducted a comprehensive evaluation on a diverse set of datasets covering DGA, DNS tunneling techniques, malware classification, and phishing/malicious URL classification. The overall results show that our model outperforms six character-based deep learning models and four BERT-based models on multiple classification tasks. To summarize, the main contributions of this paper are as follows: • We introduce DomURLs_BERT, a specialized BERT-based encoder pre-trained on a large-scale multilingual corpus of URLs, domain names, and DGA datasets. • We propose a light preprocessing tailored to the characteristics of URLs and domain names, and train domainspecific tokenizer. • We evaluate DomURLs_BERT on various malicious URLs and domain names classification tasks, including DGA, DNS tunneling, malware classification, and phishing. • We conduct our experiments on both binary and multi-class classification tasks. • We compare our model with several state-of-the-art deep learning models, including character-based models and pre-trained cybersecurity BERT models.\n\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews related work in the field of malicious domain and URL detection. In Section 3, we describe the proposed method for DomURLs_BERT pre-training. Sections 4 presents the experimental results. Finally, Section 5 concludes the paper and outlines potential directions for future research. 2Related Work The field of natural language processing is currently undergoing a revolutionary transformation, driven by the advent of large pre-trained language models (PLMs) based on the groundbreaking Transformer architecture [18].

        "content": "A PREPRINT - SEPTEMBER 17, 2024 applying these models to domain-specific tasks poses challenges, as general models often fail to represent domainspecific terms and contexts not covered in their training data. To address this issue, domain-specific PLMs have been developed, such as BioBERT [34] for biomedical text and SciBERT [35] for scientific literature. Similarly, in the cybersecurity domain, several models based on the BERT architecture [25] have been created to capture domain-specific language and improve performance on cybersecurity-related tasks [22].\n\nFor instance, CyBERT [36] is a domain-specific variant of BERT pre-trained on a large cybersecurity corpus using MLM. It focuses on generating contextualized embeddings specifically designed for cybersecurity tasks like cyber threat intelligence and malware detection. In the same context, CySecBERT [21] is a domain-adapted version of BERT pre-trained on large cybersecurity corpora. It is designed to improve performance across multiple cybersecurity tasks, including classification and named entity recognition while addressing challenges like catastrophic forgetting during domain adaptation. CySecBERT has demonstrated superior performance compared to both BERT and CyBERT in several cybersecurity tasks. Additionally, SecureBERT [20], based on the RoBERTa architecture, incorporates continual pre-training with a specialized tokenizer and fine-tuned pre-trained weights to capture both general and cybersecurity-specific language. Evaluated on MLM and NER tasks, SecureBERT has shown promising results in comprehending cybersecurity text. On the other hand, SecBERT [19], developed from scratch, is trained on various cybersecurity corpora, such as \"APTnotes\" and \"CASIE,\" and targets a broad range of cybersecurity data.\n\nMore recently, several models have focused on specific tasks within the cybersecurity domain. For example, MalBERT [37], a BERT-based model, is specialized in detecting malicious software. Similarly, Li et al. [29] introduced URLBERT, the first pre-trained model specifically designed for URL classification and detection tasks. URLBERT incorporates novel pre-training techniques, such as self-supervised contrastive learning and virtual adversarial training, to enhance its understanding of URL structures and robustness, achieving state-of-the-art results in phishing detection and web page classification. Motivated by the success of PLMs in cybersecurity tasks, we propose DomURLs_BERT, a specialized BERT-based encoder pre-trained on a large multilingual corpus of URLs, domain names, and DGA datasets. This paper contextualizes DomURLs_BERT by reviewing recent studies on the classification of malicious domain names and URLs. For a detailed review of existing large language models in cybersecurity, readers can refer to the recent study by Xu et al. [22]. 2.1Malicious domain names classification Detecting malicious domains, especially those generated by domain generation algorithms, is a crucial task in cybersecurity. Early work by Yadav et al. [1] laid the foundation by focusing on detecting algorithmically generated malicious domain names through linguistic analysis. Building on this, Cucchiarelli et al. [9] proposed using n-gram features, enhancing the ability to capture linguistic patterns in DGA-generated domains. Liew and Law [17] further advanced the field by introducing subword tokenization techniques for DGA classification, a method that allows more granular token analysis, improving model robustness against unseen domain variations. Shi et al. [8] explored machine learning techniques, particularly extreme machine learning, for detecting malicious domain names. This approach demonstrates the effectiveness of using machine learning models to identify domains that exhibit abnormal patterns. Tian et al. [32] introduced Dom-bert, a pre-trained model designed to detect malicious domains, leveraging contextual information embedded in domain names to enhance detection performance. In the broader context, Kang [3] reviewed various malicious domain detection techniques, while Hamroun et al. [11] focused specifically on lexical-based methods, emphasizing the importance of features derived from the domain names themselves. Together, these works underscore the importance of both lexical features and advanced machine-learning techniques in detecting DGA-generated and malicious domains. 2.2Malicious URLs classification In the field of malicious URLs detection, machine learning and deep learning approaches have been extensively studied and developed, with significant advancements in recent years. These approaches can be broadly categorized into traditional machine learning methods, neural network-based methods, and transformer-based models. Traditional machine learning methods, which rely on manually engineered features, were initially prominent in malicious URL detection. Sahoo et al. [2] provided a comprehensive survey of these early efforts, highlighting how machine learning techniques such as support vector machines, decision trees, naive Bayes, and random forests were applied to extract statistical and lexical features from URLs. Similarly, Aljabri et al. [4] reviewed more recent methods and highlighted the shift toward deep learning techniques due to their ability to automate feature extraction and improve detection performance.\n\nThe shift towards deep learning led to the development of several promising models. In this context, Le et al. [6] proposed URLNet, a deep learning-based method that captures both character- and word-level representations of URLs 3",

[15] performed a comparative study between shallow and deep networks, concluding that deep networks outperform traditional machine learning models by capturing more complex patterns in URLs. Afzal et al. [16] took this further by introducing Urldeepdetect, a deep learning model that integrates semantic vector models to enhance URL representation.\n\nMore recently, transformer-based models have emerged as a dominant approach, driven by their capacity to understand the semantic and contextual information of URLs. As previously mentioned, the BERT model and its variants have been particularly influential in this area. Chang et al. [26] and Otieno et al. [27] explored the application of BERT for URL detection, demonstrating that transformer models outperform traditional methods in terms of both accuracy and robustness. Building on these efforts, Su et al. [28] and Yu et al. [5] proposed modified BERT variants that further enhance semantic understanding for malicious URL detection. The introduction of URLBERT by Li et al. [29], a contrastive and adversarial pre-trained model, continues this trend, pushing the boundaries of transformer-based URL classification. Several other transformer-based models have also been proposed, focusing on improving phishing URL detection. For example, URLTran [33] applies transformers specifically to phishing detection, while Bozkir et al. [13] introduced GramBeddings, a neural network that utilizes n-gram embeddings to enhance the identification of phishing URLs. This direction was further extended by Liu et al. [30], who combined a pre-trained language model with multi-level feature attention for improved detection accuracy.\n\nOverall, the progression from traditional machine learning approaches to advanced deep learning and transformer-based models has significantly improved the ability to classify malicious URLs. The integration of semantic understanding, n-gram embeddings, and pre-trained models has pushed the state-of-the-art, enabling more accurate and robust detection of malicious URLs across different attack types. 3Methodology This section presents our methodology for pre-training the DomURLs_BERT encoder, focusing on the collection of pre-training data, preprocessing of domain names and URLs, tokenizer training, and domain-adaptive pre-training.\n\nTable 1: Pre-training Dataset Training Development domain names 19,941,474 1,049,558 URLs 355,116,387 18,690,330 Total 375,057,861 19,739,888 3.1Pre-training data We have collected a large-scale pre-training corpus of domain names and URLs from the following datasets: • mC4: The multilingual colossal Common Crawl Corpus4.

The final pre-training dataset contains 375,057,861 samples for model training and 19,739,888 samples for development. Table 1 provides details on the collected dataset, which is publicly available on Hugging Face Datasets8. 3.2Pre-training Procedure 3.2.1Preprocessing Figure 1: Overall URL structure A URL consists of several components, which can be grouped into three main parts: the scheme (protocol), the domain name, and the path. Figure 1 illustrates the overall structure of a URL (source9). Our proposed input preprocessing method involves removing the protocol identifier and splitting the URL into two parts: the domain name and the path.\n\nThese two parts are delimited by special tokens, [DOMAIN] and [PATH], indicating the start of the domain name and the URL path, respectively. Additionally, if the input URL contains an IP address instead of a domain name, we use the [IP] and [IPv6] special tokens in place of [DOMAIN] for IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, respectively. Finally, the [CLS] and [SEP] tokens are appended to the start and end of the input URL or domain, as follows: Figure 2: A sample of preprocessed domain names and URLs 3.2.2Tokenizer training After cleaning and preprocessing the data, we trained our tokenizer from scratch using the SentencePiece tokenization method, which employs the Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) algorithm [42]. SentencePiece is language-agnostic and does not require any pre-tokenization, as it processes input as a sequence of Unicode characters. For tokenizer training, we utilized the HuggingFace tokenizers library10. The vocabulary size was set to 32,000. 3.2.3Domain-adaptive pre-training Domain-adaptive pre-training has been shown to enhance the contextualized word embeddings of existing domaingeneric Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) [43]. This improvement has also been demonstrated in cybersecurity applications, where several domain-adapted models have been proposed [20, 21, 29, 33, 31, 22]. Following this trend, we continued the pre-training of the BERT-base encoder introduced in [25]. The model consists of approximately 110 million parameters, with 12 transformer layers, a hidden dimension size of 768, and 12 attention heads. 8https://hf.co/datasets/amahdaouy/Web_DomURLs 9https://www.seoforgooglenews.com/p/everything-urls-news-publishers 10https://github.com/huggingface/tokenizers 5",

        "content": "A PREPRINT - SEPTEMBER 17, 2024 5Conclusion In this work, we introduced DomURLs_BERT, a novel state-of-the-art pre-trained language model for detecting and classifying malicious or suspicious domain names and URLs. DomURLs_BERT is pre-trained using the masked language modeling objective on a large-scale, multilingual corpus comprising URLs, domain names, and domain generation algorithm datasets. We presented a detailed methodology for data collection, preprocessing, and domainadaptive pre-training.\n\nTo evaluate the performance of our model, we conducted experiments on several binary and multi-class classification tasks related to domain names and URLs, including phishing and malware detection, DGA identification, and DNS tunneling. Our results demonstrate that DomURLs_BERT achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple datasets. Furthermore, the findings highlight that character-based deep learning models, such as RNNs, CNNs, and their combinations, serve as strong end-to-end baselines for URL and domain name classification. In comparison, fine-tuning a domain-generic pre-trained BERT model and adapting BERT-based models to the cybersecurity domain consistently outperforms the baseline character-based models on most benchmark datasets. Future work includes evaluating the model performance on other domain names and URLs classification tasks and exploring robust fine-tuning approaches for dealing with adversarial attacks.\n\nReferences [1] Sandeep Yadav, Ashwath Kumar Krishna Reddy, AL Narasimha Reddy, and Supranamaya Ranjan.
