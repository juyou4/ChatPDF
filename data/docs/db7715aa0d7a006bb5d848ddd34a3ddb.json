The Attention Alignment Module (AAM), implemented as a pointwise convolution layer, produces intermediate attention maps from a collection of student attention maps. The number of intermediate maps matches the total attention maps of the teacher model, encompassing all layers and heads. These intermediate maps are then directly compared to the teacher’s attention maps using KL-Divergence, without any form of reduction. 4.1Attention Map as a Knowledge types of attention.

The Attention Alignment Module (AAM), implemented as a pointwise convolution layer, produces intermediate attention maps from a collection of student attention maps. The number of intermediate maps matches the total attention maps of the teacher model, encompassing all layers and heads.
